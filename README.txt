Networked-Chat-Application
==========================

This program is a networked chat application that uses basic Java networking. Instead of two separate programs, the program prompts the user on startup whether they want to set up a server or client. The program then accesses only the code relevant to the user choice and prompts the user with further instructions on how to proceed.

Note: for the program to work properly, the server and any number of clients must run on the same computer.
